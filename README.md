# HTML5 Bookmark Maker

The HTML5 Bookmark Maker is a very quick way of creating website links<br>
for your browser.<br>
<br>
To get started, go to 01-templates where you will see a list of templates<br>
ready for you to edit. To avoid overwriting the template, make a copy of it:<br>
<br>
cp tpl-bookmarks-10.html html5-bookmarks-0001.html<br>
<br>
Now you can edit the file html5-bookmarks-0001.html using a text or HTML<br>
editor. Here you will be able to enter your website links, and the colour<br>
of the background and text.<br>
<br>
